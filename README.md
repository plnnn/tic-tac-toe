# Tic Tac Toe Game (React)

A simple Tic Tac Toe game built with React that allows you to play against a friend or select from 5 different AI modes. The game features the following AI types:
- Random Moves
- Rule-Based AI
- Mini-Max AI
- Alpha-Beta Pruning AI
- Monte Carlo Tree Search AI

## Features
- Play against a friend (local multiplayer).
- Play against the AI with multiple AI types to choose from.
- AI moves are generated based on selected algorithms.
- Simple and clean user interface with board state updates.
- Game state is displayed (turns, winner, draw).
- Restart game or go back to the start screen.

## AI Modes

1. **Random Moves**: The AI picks random available moves.
2. **Rule-Based**: The AI follows simple strategies to block the opponent and win.
3. **Mini-Max**: The AI uses the Mini-Max algorithm to calculate the optimal move.
4. **Alpha-Beta Pruning**: A more optimized version of the Mini-Max algorithm that reduces the number of nodes evaluated in the game tree.
5. **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**: The AI uses simulations to evaluate possible moves and improve performance over time.
